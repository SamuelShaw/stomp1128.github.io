Week two is complete at The Iron Yard and I'm starting to see the light!  The long hours and heavy workload have been challenging but the concepts are beginning to make more and more sense with each assignment.  The initial challenges of working with Github and understanding some of the terminology being used in the lectures are gone and we are now focusing on more complicated projects.

Some of the other challenges from week one like creating a storyboard, using auto layout, creating classes, functions, and properties are now common items that we use each day and are becoming more and more familar.  I've also began to notice that each assignment builds off of the previous assignments which has been helpful because it really gives us a chance to get the repitition and practice that we need.

One item that I tried to focus on particularly this week is organizing my code into blocks and understanding where things should go within classes.  As the projects we work on get larger and larger I am starting to see how this will become a very important skill.  Also I put a lot of emphasis on learning how to create functions and why they are important although I feel like I still need some practice when it comes to giving them useful names!

Overall the first two weeks have been very exciting and I'm starting to see exactly what types of applications I will be able to create with my new programming knowledge.  I'm looking forward to what's next!

What is the best way to create and deploy projects when creating software?  The answer is Github, a source control software used frequently by developers.  Github is packed with some excellent features used for managing workflow with two of the most commonly used and most useful tools being branching and pull requests.  

There are several important reasons why developers "branch" and why it is useful but first of all it is important to understand what branching is.  Imagine you've been working on a project and you have a solid base of code and now you are ready to start implementing new features.  Branching lets you create a new workspace within the project where you can try out new code without affecting the "master" branch.  This feature is also very useful when you have multiple developers collaborating together on a project.  Branching allows individuals to work on a project simultaneously without stepping on eachother's toes, by divdiing the workload into sections using branches.  Another reason why branching is so useful to developers is to backup and track the work they have completed.  When changes are made within Github you are given the option to save or "commit" these changes.  Over a period of time you will notice all of your commits listed within a timeline allowing you to easily target a specific area of the project or revert back to a previous version of your work.  

Once all of the work within a specific branch is complete the next step would be to create a pull request.  A pull request allows you to submit your changes within a particular branch to be accepted by the master branch.  Within iOS development, an excellent example of this would be if you were releasing a new version of an existing application that is already available in the App Store.  Your branch would represent the newest version of the app and once completed you would submit your pull request.  If approved by the person managing the app, your pull request would then be merged in to the master branch and the users of your app would be notified of a new version they could download in order to be updated with the newest changes.

Branching is arguably one of the most important features within Github and is key competancy for any serious developer.  Without the use of branches it would be nearly impossible to stay organized, track progress, or work in a team environment when creating software and for this reason I would say it is just as important to the success of a project as the code that is written!
